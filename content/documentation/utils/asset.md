For caching purposes, all static assets are automatically revisioned by gulp (for example, `icon.svg` → `icon-d41d8cd98f.svg`). As such, this file includes helper functions for retrieving revisioned files.

## `Asset::requireUrl($asset)`
Return a revisioned static asset URL.

## `Asset::requirePath($asset)`
Return a revisioned static asset path.
